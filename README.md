[Consul](https://www.consul.io) Client for Swift

ConsulSwift connects to `http://localhost:8500` by default.

You can change the default behaviour by calling an other initializer.

```swift
let consul = Consul(url: otherBaseURL)
```

## Completeness of Content

I'm sure I haven't implemented all API Endpoints Consul provides. Feel free to create a pull request or create an issue.


## Examples

### Synchronous Example

```swift
// get consul instance
let consul = Consul()

// get agent members
let members = consul.agentMembers()

// check members result
switch members {
case .success(let members):
    // do whatever you like with members which is kind of [ConsulAgentMember]
case .failure(let error):
    // handle error
}
```

### Asynchronous Example

```swift
// get consul instance
let consul = Consul()

// get agent members
consul.agentMembers { members in
    // check members result
    switch members {
    case .success(let members):
        // do whatever you like with members which is kind of [ConsulAgentMember]
    case .failure(let error):
        // handle error
    }
}
```
