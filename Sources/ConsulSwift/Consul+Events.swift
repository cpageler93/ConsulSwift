    ///   - name: Specifies the name of the event to fire. This is specified as part of the URL. This name must not start with an underscore, since those are reserved for Consul internally.
    ///   - datacenter: Specifies the datacenter to query. This will default to the datacenter of the agent being queried. This is specified as part of the URL as a query parameter
    ///   - node: Specifies a regular expression to filter by node name. This is specified as part of the URL as a query parameter.
    ///   - service: Specifies a regular expression to filter by service name. This is specified as part of the URL as a query parameter.
    ///   - tag: Specifies a regular expression to filter by tag. This is specified as part of the URL as a query parameter.
    /// - Returns: Result with fired Event
